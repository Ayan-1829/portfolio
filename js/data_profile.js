const DATA_ABOUT = {
  academic: `I am <strong>Ayan Sarkar</strong>, a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Green University of Bangladesh. With a strong foundation in engineering and a deep interest in technology, problem solving,, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
    <br><br>
    My areas of interest include programming, machine learning, computer hardwares, and emerging technologies. I enjoy teaching students, guiding them through technical concepts, and helping them build practical skills for the future. Alongside academics, I also have experience in creative work through commission painting and artwork, which reflects my passion for both logic and creativity. I believe in hard work, consistency, and always exploring new ideas.`,

  artQuote: `"The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls." — Pablo Picasso`,
  artBio: `I am Ayan Sarkar, an educator and a painter. My artworks explore texture, emotion, and the quiet stories that live between moments.
    Each canvas is a world I build away from lectures and laptops.`,
